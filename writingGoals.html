    <p> Despite having an associates degree in computer science and being eight months <br/>
        away from my bachelors degree in computer science I still have little idea what<br/>
        it is that I want to do once I have graduated. I think these courses do a very <br/>
        poor job at prepairing people to make these decisions, so I will need to do    <br/>
        something on my own if I would like to prepare myself.</p>
